Contributing
====================


Reporting bugs
--------------

Bugs are reported using the `Issue tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/cbrunet/python-poppler/issues>`_.

When you report a bug, try to be as specific as possible, and provide all the relevant information:

* Version of poppler
* Version of python-poppler
* Operating system name and version
* Python version

If an exception occured, provide the entire stack trace.

Before submitting a new bug, please verify it is not already reported. If it is, verify if
you can provide additional information.


If you can, consider pull_request_.




Requesting features
-------------------

Suggestions and feature requests can be submitted using the `Issue tracker on GitHub <https://github.com/cbrunet/python-poppler/issues>`_ as well.

However, you should understand that the main goal of **python-poppler** is to provide a Python binding
to the poppler-cpp library. Therefore, if you need a feature that is not currently in poppler-cpp,
we will probably not implement it in python-poppler. But if you integrate a new feature in poppler-cpp,
we will certainly add it to python-poppler.
